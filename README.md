# Currently in work

- Refactor different parts of the code for a better usage of the dependency injection
- Refactor Statistics to remove dependency to telerik
- Refactor code to apply better to the OOP pattern
- Better unit test coverage


# Dependencies

There is a dependency to the telerik universal framework. I try to remove this in the coming weeks. Feel free to help me with that.
All other dependencies are available via nugget.
