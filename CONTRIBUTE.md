## Feature Requests / Bug reports
Is there a feature you would like to see in a future release? Or have you found a bug? Create a new issue and give describe it as good as possible.


## Code
You want to contribute code? Great! Look for issues with the following labels, depending on what you are looking for:

- first-timer-only: 

To quote [firsttimersonly.com](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/): "I'm willing to hold your hand so you can make your first PR. This issue is rather a bit easier than normal. And anyone who's already contributed to open source isn't allowed to touch this one!"

- easy:

This issues should be easy to solve and are great to start if you already have contributed to OSS before and are new here.

- mentor:

This means that I can provide you additional information to help getting started and a basic idea how to solve this.

For any issue regardless of the label I want to encourage you to ask if there are any questions. I'm happy to help.
